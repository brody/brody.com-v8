I"Ñ<p>I stumbled across this talk &amp; it spoke to me and the conflicting priorities rolling round in my head.</p>

<p>Joel perfectly defines an anxiety common to Product Designers, but also outlines a simple way to prioritize what to learn and work on out of all the opportunities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™m a designer, so I should probably learn responsive patterns, methods for remote user testing, Sketch, motion graphics, Framer, keep up to date with current design trends, and a million other things.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™m a developer, so I should probably learn SVG animations, Node or React or Ember, BEM principles, new web inspector features, Vim or at least better Sublime workflows, and a million other things.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™m also a human being, so I canâ€™t possibly learn all these things. I have to choose.</p>

  <p>Soâ€¦ what do I choose? Full Stack Anxiety is that creeping doubt, when you just donâ€™t know what the right choice is. Do I grow as a designer or do I grow as a developer? As a manager, a teacher, a business-person?</p>

<h1 id="1-ask-yourself">1. Ask yourself</h1>

<p>â€œWhat kind of work do I want to do in the future?â€ And, when approaching a new skill ask, â€œWhat am I becoming by learning this?â€ If that skill doesnâ€™t help you become the person you want to be, then it may not be worth your attention.</p>

<h1 id="2-create-some-structure">2. Create some structure.</h1>

<p>Remember that big, scary list that Califa presented? Make one for yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œAs anxiety provoking as the list is, itâ€™s better than a general, vague panic,â€ Califa said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A bit of organizationâ€Šâ€”â€Ševen a simple list on paperâ€Šâ€”â€Šeliminates the need to keep juggling those tasks in your brain.</p>

<h1 id="3-take-the-decision-out-of-the-moment">3. Take the decision out of the moment.</h1>

<p>Califa suggests creating a simple if/then statement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If this skill can be applicable to other parts of my life. Then Iâ€™ll learn it.</li>
  <li>If this is a skill thatâ€™ll be in demand for years to come. Then Iâ€™ll learn it.</li>
  <li>If this brings me closer to who I want to be. Then Iâ€™ll learn it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, this helps reduce that overwhelming list to something more approachable.</p>

<h1 id="4-stop-chasing-trends">4. Stop chasing trends.</h1>

<p>Sketch kills Photoshop. React kills Angular. Rails kills PHP. JS kills Railsâ€¦and on and on. Thereâ€™s always going to be something new. And all of them will die at some point.</p>

<p>Prioritize transferrable skills, like typography, programming patterns and management. The more longevity a skill has, the better an idea it is to learn it.</p>

<h1 id="5-prioritize-happiness">5. Prioritize happiness.</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œAt the end of the day, life isnâ€™t all about work, and nothing is worth being that anxious over.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if youâ€™re still having trouble reducing that to-learn list to something manageable, Califa has a way to make it simple.</p>
