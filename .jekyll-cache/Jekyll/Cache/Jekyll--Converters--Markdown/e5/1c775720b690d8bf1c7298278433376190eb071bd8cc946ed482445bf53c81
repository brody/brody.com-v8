<p>You can tell a lot about your initial experience with a company.
Iâ€™ve had poor experiences with both big and small companies.</p>

<p>Conversely, Iâ€™ve had well managed experiences, between initial interactions as well as onboarding, indicative of companies who are intentional about every part of the company.</p>

<p>The recruitment process is a highly tension-filled time, but donâ€™t ignore your spidey-sense about the clunky first experience, as it will most likely reflect the entire companies culture.</p>
