<p>When watching a movie for the 2nd time, you get to enjoy the details because you already know the major plot points.</p>

<p>That is how I approach reading non-fiction books too. Iâ€™ll find a summary of the book Iâ€™m about to read so I am across the major beats, then dive in so the details already have context and I can get even more out of the book on the first read.</p>

<p>Also useful are any talks given by the author as it gives you an even deeper understanding of their point of view.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ICS9VI4">Reinventing Organizations</a> by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Laloux comes <a href="http://joel.is/50-books-that-transformed-my-business-and-my-life/">highly recommended</a> by Bufferâ€™s, co-founder &amp; CEO, Joel Gascoigne, so much so that itâ€™s a <a href="https://buffer.com/journey">prerequisite read</a> for new hires at the startup.</p>

  <li>You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.</li>
  <li>The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence. It is to act with yesterdayâ€™s logic.</li>
  <li>Seeing is not believing, believing is seeing. You see things, not as they are, but as you are.</li>
  <li>Humanity evolves in stages. We are not like a tree that grows consistently, but like a caterpillar that becomes a butterfly.</li>
  <li>Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for.</li>
  <li>Every challenge you encounter in life is a fork in the road. You have the choice to choose which way to goâ€Šâ€”â€Šbackward, forward, breakdown or breakthrough.</li>
  <li>The most existing breakthroughs of the 21st century will not occur because of technology, but because of expanding concept of what it means to be human. (John Naisbitt)</li>
  <li>The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have built the society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.</li>
  <li>Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come.</li>
  <li>Humans are born to care. Our institutions magnify or depress the human capacity to care.</li>
  <li>Teams should not grow more then 12 people. If they do, they should be split.</li>
  <li>Team members must appraise each other every year based on competency models they devise themselves.</li>
  <li>Bureaucracies are built by and for people who busy themselves proving they are necessary, especially when they suspect they are not.</li>
  <li>You were not hired to fill a specific job description. You were hired to consistently be looking around for the most valuable work you could be doing.</li>
  <li>You can measure an organization by the number of lies you must tell to be a part of it.</li>
  <li>The general rule seems to be that consciousness of the organization cannot exceed the level of consciousness of its leader.</li>
