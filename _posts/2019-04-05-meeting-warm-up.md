Recently, I've been running a game of Pictionary, before our designer catch-up meetings, to break the ice and get the creative juices flowing.

You only need a few things to run one yourself, with both local and remote team members alike.

# Ingredients

- Whiteboard app ‚Äî [Invision Freehand](https://www.invisionapp.com/feature/freehand){: target="\_blank"}, there are plenty of other options like [Miro](https://realtimeboard.com/){: target="\_blank"}, [Witeboard](https://witeboard.com){: target="\_blank"}
- Words/Phrases ‚Äî [Pictionary Generator](https://peachytools.com/pictionary-generator){: target="\_blank"}
